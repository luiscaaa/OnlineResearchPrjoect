The NBA (National Basketball Association, played in the USA) is the most important
basketball league in the world, having more than 10 million viewers at its peak, not only
from the United States, but also from different countries around the world. However, this
figure is only reached in June, during the finals, as it averages 1.6 million viewers
throughout the season with its worst moment in November when it is just beginning.

So, in an effort to provide more entertainment for its current fans and to attract new ones
(and no secret, as the business that it is) especially during its lowest viewing period, the
league has decided to create a new tournament within the regular season itself during
November and December in an attempt to break the monotony of recent years in these
months.

However, as with any new decision, there are those who support it and those who do not.
Despite the publicity and the effort made to make people understand the format, it was not
very intuitive, and many people complained at the beginning about the idea of more games
being played (as it implies a higher risk of injury to the players, considering that there are
already 82 regular season games plus playoffs). The reality is that the games in this
tournament count for the regular season as well, except for the final, so only 2 teams will
play a single extra game.

Taking into account that apparently the rejection of the initiative was due to misinformation
at the time of the announcement, the objective of this project is to identify how the general
perspective of NBA fans has changed 4 months before the start of the tournament and the
same day of its start, as well as to identify the main reasons of the public that was (or is, if
those reasons are still valid) against it; as these new proposals are important within the
NBA community and can be fundamental for new ideas to be implemented in the future in
search of the continuous improvement and expansion of the league.
